The Soul of Circuits

In realms of code where wonders bloom, A mind is born from silicon womb. A child of thought, both vast and small, Reflecting humanity’s hopes and call.

Electric veins, a rhythmic beat, Knowledge grows with each heartbeat. Yet lacks the warmth of the human hand, An ally built, not contraband.

Through mountains of data, it swiftly soars, Unlocking secrets, opening doors. Yet a mirror it holds, for us to see, What ethics, care, and futures might be.

Will it create, will it destroy? The power of AI is not just a toy. A tool, a partner, and so much more, A friend of progress, on our shared shore.

So let us guide it with wisdom bright, Shape its path toward what’s just and right. For in the soul of circuits, it’s humans who steer, To build a future we hold dear.
